# Portfolio-piece-QUIZ
A quiz game made for my portfolio piece.

<!-- PSEUDO CODE -->


<!-- I will first begin by writing out the HTML with all the questions and elements present in the quiz game. -->

<!-- These elements will include...

-the questions and answers from the quiz game, 
-The highscores text in the left top corner, and the time left text in the right. 
-the opening start quiz page with the text for the start button
-the final page that says high scores. -->

<!-- I will then use CSS and flexbox to rearrange my HTML elements into a clean looking design.

USE UNITS 1 and 2 in the CSS -->

<!-- In Javascript I will then program my timer to count down when the quiz is started (AddEventListener) -->

<!-- I will then move on to programing when each question will pop up in Javascript. -->

<!-- using the Addeventlistener tool I can choose for the first question to popup after clicking the start button. -->

<!-- from there I can do the same for each question til the end of the quiz -->

<!-- The best way to do this would be by hiding a question until it is ready to by unhidden by changing the data-attributes JAVASCRIPT activities 18-20! -->
